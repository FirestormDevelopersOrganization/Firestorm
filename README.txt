Welcome to the Firestorm git repository!

If you are unfamiliar with using Git, I recommend just using the GUI kit that is available with Windows. To download the latest source code, just click on the plus on the left hand side of the GUI window. Then click clone, and then click on this repository. Git should automatically clone this repo to your machine. If you have any questions just ask!
