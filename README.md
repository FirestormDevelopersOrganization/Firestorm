# Welcome to the Firestorm git repository!

### Are you looking for the developer code?

If you are a developer for this repository, then you are probably looking for the `dev` branch. Look for the drop down menu above.

Important: if you do a `git clone`, make sure to checkout the dev branch! If you don't do this, you will not be editing the dev code:

```
git checkout dev
```

### Are you looking for our stable build? (we don't have one right now)

This is the master branch. This is where we will be merging all of our code that is stable. We will continually merge code from the `dev` branch and eventually have a working product.

If you are unfamiliar with using Git, I recommend just using the GUI kit that is available with Windows. To download the latest source code, just click on the plus on the left hand side of the GUI window. Then click clone, and then click on this repository. Git should automatically clone this repo to your machine. If you have any questions just ask!
